= Introduction =

Here are some tips that may help us to maintain the project effectively and efficiently.

= Running the tests =
We added JUnit tests in r50, and have been slowly refactoring the code and adding tests to support the refactoring. In the process we're removing unnecessary dependencies on Android libraries, etc. By removing these dependencies the tests can currently (r67) be run using the standard JUnit 3 test runner. Conversely the tests that rely on content in the /Resources project folder currently fail when run using the Android JUnit test runner as the contents of this folder is not pushed to the emulator or devices. We're aware of this limitation, see http://code.google.com/p/android-daisy-epub-reader/issues/detail?id=10 For now please use the standard JUnit test runner from eclipse; and see http://dtmilano.blogspot.com/2009/12/android-testing-external-libraries.html for some tips on configuring the test runner correctly.

   * Please update the [http://android-daisy-epub-reader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/releasenotes.txt releasenotes.txt] with siginficant changes. Note some revisions don't need comments, and those made through the web UI will not be recorded in the document anyway.
