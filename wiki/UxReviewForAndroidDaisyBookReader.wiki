= Introduction =

The team met on January 8th 2010 to review current UI (Daisy Reader release 82) and discussed next steps in user experience and user interaction to get the best results for users to easy find, access, navigate and read audio books. This UX Proposal based on the meeting minutes and discussions.


= First Time Installation =

When users launch the application for the first time, a welcome splash page will display in dialog, offering welcoming words and top quick tips to explain how the application works. Checkbox control will be offered for users to turn off this dialog when application starts next time. This dialog can be accessed again via the Help button from the application menu.

Closing this dialog, a simple menu will be offered on the screen:

  * Open book
  * Search for books

== Open book ==

Open book link will show the SD card file manager for user to navigate to the folder containing books. Near future, the file manager can search and give list of books available on the storage automatically.

== Search ==

Search was considered for near future, where the Daisy Reader can consume data from public APIs offering daisy books for free download, or offering bookmark list of sites listing free books. Lists will natively be rendered in the Daisy UI, so users can easily pick the book of interest.


= Android Buttons =

== Back ==
== Menu ==

The menu will have 6 buttons.
== Search ==


= Application Menu =


= Reading book =

== Navigating Content ==

== Navigating chapters ==
